## Instruction

This game is based on the fight in the droid factory in the second episode of StarWars (except the droids).
To set the game up use the following simple commands:
/setlobby - To set the lobby spawn
/setingame - To set the ingame spawn
/setspectator - To set the spectator spawn
/setwin - To set the win location. If a player enters this location in a radius of five blocks, he will win the game

If that is done the game is ready to be played. To play it just stop the server, change the "setup" value in the config.yml from "true" to "false" and start the server again.

Regarding the topic: It is possible to create different modules in the game with different machines, sounds and particle effects to create a much better game experience. Machines are bound to modules, which are bound to a specific area in the map. If a player enters this area the machines will start working, if he leaves the area the machines will stop working. Players will get damage by fire, lava, magma and blocks. They will also get damage if they touch anvils. (Be aware of anvils)

# Template

If you want a template map and game configuration you can simply download it <a href="http://dev-tmxx.net/Template.zip">here</a>. This contains a map, the plugin and every necessary configuration.

# Setup

To set up modules use the following commands:
/module - To display help
/module pos1 - To set the first position of the selection
/module pos2 - To set the second position of the selection
/module create <Name> - To create a module with the specific name using the prior specified selection
/module start <Name> - To set the start position of the module (Will act as checkpoint)
/module end <Name> - To set the end position of the module (Used to calculate percentage)

To set up machines use the following commands:
/machine - To display help
/machine pos1 - To set the first position of the selection
/machine pos2 - To set the second position of the selection
/machine create <Name> - To create a machine with the specific name
/machine stage <Name> - To stage all blocks of the machine in the current selection. Block stages are used to create machine animations.
/machine interval <Name> - To set the interval in ticks of the stage change
/machine module <Name> <Module> - To bind the machine to the specific module

To set up sounds use the following command:
/soundspot <SoundType> <Volume> <Pitch> <Interval> <Module> - To create a sound spot with the specific type, volume, pitch and interval to be played.

To set up effects use the following command:
/effectspot <Effect> <VectorX> <VectorY> <VectorZ> <Speed> <Amount> <Interval> - To create an effect spot with the specific effect, vector, speed, amount and interval to be displayed.

## Get Started

**If you already know how to use Maven, then more than likely the following steps are irrelevant for you. Just do your usual thing.**

Don't worry, we made a video! Check it out at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5HXS0l-VwQ

---

First things first, you need to have the Java JDK8 installed. You can find the appropriate version here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

Then you need to have git installed. You can find the appropriate version for your OS here: https://git-scm.com/

There are no other required dependencies, however Maven is optional if you want to set up your own development environment outside of what we do for you.

## Running

If you're on Windows, you'll want to run all of these commands inside Git Bash, which is a program installed when you installed Git. You can paste by right clicking inside of the window.

If you don't have this Git repository cloned yet, click on clone or download. If you have an SSH key on your account, use the SSH link. Otherwise use the HTTPS link if you want to use your GitHub username and password.

Then run

```bash
git clone <link>
```

To run your server, do:

```bash
./run-server.sh
```

On first run this will download and compile the Spigot version that you're using for the contest. Because you're using this exact version of Spigot for the entire contest, you can safely use CraftBukkit and Minecraft Server code.

This wrapper around the Spigot server has a few extra features that are not included inside of regular Spigot. If you type `stop` to stop the Minecraft Server, it'll automatically recompile your code and restart the server. To fully stop the server, type `exit` to safely stop the server and exit the recompilation loop. If you're on Windows, you won't have a `exit` command and will instead be asked every loop if you want to recompile.
